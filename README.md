# Introduction

Fluence Labs provides an open protocol and open source framework to create modern Web 3.0 internet applications without having to rely on centralized and untrustworthy parties.

At the core of Fluence applications is Aquamarine: An open-source development and runtime environment for decentralized applications consisting of:

* [Aqua](https://github.com/fluencelabs/aqua), a non-Touring complete interface description language \(IDL\) to compose distributed Wasm services deployed no different nodes into applications
* [AIR](https://github.com/fluencelabs/air), an interpreter/VM for moving data and scripts across network destinations programmatically specified by the Aqua application script
* [Marine](https://github.com/fluencelabs/marine), an Aqua VM and Wasm runtime environment for deployment on peer-to-peer nodes, such as Fluence Labs' peer-to-peer node reference implementation

Aqua allows application developers to compose applications by using and reusing Wasm services deployed to one or more peers of a peer-to-peer network.





Aquamarine provides the programming and runtime tools to allow developers to avoid the typical peer-to-peer development challenges and accelerate the development and deployment of distributed services and applications.









The remainder of this document introduces a set of incremental, hands-on tutorials developing with Aquamarine on the Fluence stack.
