# Overview


In the Quick Start section we incrementally created a distributed, database-backed request processing application using existing services with Aquamarine. Of course, we left a lot of detail uncovered including where the services we used came from in the first place. In this section, we tackle the very issue of development and deployment of service component.


Before we proceed, please make sure your Fluence environment is [setup](../recipes_recipes/recipes_setting_up.md) and ready to go. Moreover, we are going to run our own Fluence node to test our services in a network environment. Please refer to the [Running a Local Fluence Node](../tutorials_tutorials/tutorial_run_local_node.md) tutorial if you need support.
