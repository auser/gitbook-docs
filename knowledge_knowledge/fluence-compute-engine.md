# Fluence Compute Engine

[Fluence Compute Engine](https://github.com/fluencelabs/fce) \(FCE\) is a general purpose WebAssembly runtime that could be used in different scenarios, especially in programs based on the [ECS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) pattern or plugin architecture. It runs multi-module Wasm applications with [interface-types](https://github.com/WebAssembly/interface-types/blob/master/proposals/interface-types/Explainer.mdhttps://github.com/WebAssembly/interface-types/blob/master/proposals/interface-types/Explainer.md) and [shared-nothing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared-nothing_architecture) linking scheme.

Fluence [nodes](https://github.com/fluencelabs/fluence) use FCE to execute [Aquamarine](https://github.com/fluencelabs/aquamarine) and Wasm services.
