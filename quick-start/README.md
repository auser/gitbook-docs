# Quick Start

This section aims to get new Fluence developers up and running quickly without any deep dives into technology stacks. Instead, the focus is on presenting the essential knowledge necessary to successfully interact with a Fluence peer-to-peer network and to create distributed applications. We hope that this approach lets developers gain a good understanding on how to use Aquamarine, how peer-to-peer programming can offer a significant improvement over traditional client-server architectures and how the inherent decentralization enables business continuity.  

For the purposes of this section, developers interact with, aka reuse, with services already deployed on the Fluence peer-to-peer testnet.
