# Quick Start

This section aims to get a new Fluence application developer up and running relatively quickly without any major deep dives into Aquamarine or the Fluence stack. Instead, the focus is to present the essential knowledge necessary to successfully interact with a Fluence peer-to-peer network and to get a good understanding on how to use Aquamarine to compose network services into applications.

Enjoy !!
